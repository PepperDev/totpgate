# TODO — totpgate

> A section is removed **only** when every bullet in it is complete.
> **Complete** = zero compiler warnings + ≥ 80 % line coverage + passing tests.

## Future improvements

- **systemd service + packaging**: add `totpgated.service` to `.deb`/`.rpm`
- **IPv6 support**: `netlink.c` currently handles AF_INET only
- **Config file support**: `--config /etc/totpgated.conf` as alternative to CLI flags
- **Fuzz testing**: fuzz the auth packet parser for robustness
